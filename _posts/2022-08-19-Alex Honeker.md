excerpt: "I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. My research interests lie at the intersection of political psychology, international political economy, and party politics. I explore the determinants of citizens' attitudes towards different facets of globalization‚ economic, political, and cultural‚ as well as the role party competition plays in shaping voters' attitudes and parties' strategies. I explore these topics with a regional focus on Europe and the United States, and employing experimental, observational, survey, and text analysis methodology."
