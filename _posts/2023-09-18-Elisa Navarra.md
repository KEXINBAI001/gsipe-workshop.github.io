excerpt: "I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics affiliated to the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the European Center for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics. I am also a research fellow at the Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS). My research interests are in international trade, focusing on subsidies, political economy of trade, and firm environmental responsibility. Before starting my Ph.D., I studied at Bocconi University, where I completed a BSc and a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences, and at Université Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), where I pursued a MRes in Economics. During the a.y. 2022-23, I visited the Investment Research Section of the Division on Investment & Enterprises (DIAE) at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) working as Associate Economic Affairs Officer."
