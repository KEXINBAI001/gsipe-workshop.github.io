excerpt: "I am a Ph.D. Candidate and NSF Graduate Fellow in the Department of Political Science at the UC San Diego. My research explores the political economy of place-or how local economies affect policy preferences and behaviors. Guided by economic geography theories, I identify the ways in which individuals form relationships with the places they live, and quantify these relationships with spatial and machine learning measurement techniques. My research applies these to reconsider important questions in political economy: does economic exposure to trade affect globalization attitudes, and do these attitudes affect voting; does inequality affect support for redistribution?"
