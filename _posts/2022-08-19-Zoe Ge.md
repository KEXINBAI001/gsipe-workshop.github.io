excerpt: "I am a PhD candidate at NYU. I study IPE with a focus on international cooperation. My research disentangles the mechanisms of how interdependence shapes incentives in international cooperation, which affects the design, functioning, and even survival of international institutions. My job market paper examines the role of the WHO in facilitating states' cooperation with disease outbreak reporting. It reveals that information dissemination by international organizations (IOs) to their members empowers weak IOs to induce deeper cooperation than what their resources permit. I also study how global value chains lead to the decline of international institutions and firms' influence over trade barriers."
