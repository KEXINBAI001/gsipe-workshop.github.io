excerpt: "I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh and a Mellon Predoctoral Fellow. My main research interests lie at the intersection of international political economy and comparative politics. My dissertation generates novel insights into the political economy of job automation, the primary driver of economic polarization, by investigating the causal mechanisms influencing individuals' political attitudes and the impact of electoral institutions on political actors' responses. I study the interplay between economic, cultural, and institutional factors using mixed-methods approaches that combine quantitative analysis, text-as-data, survey experiment, and formal modeling. I am also interested in international trade, inequality, climate policy, and political methodology."
