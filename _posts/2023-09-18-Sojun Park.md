excerpt: "Sojun Park is a Ph.D. candidate in Politics at Princeton. His research expertise lies in the politics of intellectual property rights, where he studies how public interests shape business-government and inter-governmental relations. His job market paper shows how public pressure for government regulation of patented medicines leads to self-regulation by global drug companies, using game theory and statistical analysis. His other dissertation chapter explains how business interests shape trade policies for patent protection. His co-authored projects also examine how international organizations help member states maintain their autonomy over public policies and improve public accountability during national emergencies."
