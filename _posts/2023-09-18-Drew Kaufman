excerpt: "Drew Kaufman is an economic geographer and a SSHRC postdoctoral researcher at Queen's University, Canada, specializing in the debt of low-and-middle-income countries. His recently completed Ph.D. from the University of Toronto (2023) explored the political economy of the market for the Global South's debt. Drew's mixed-methods research traces capital as it circulates amongst lenders, borrowing nations, and global markets. He scrutinizes debt markets by drawing on both primary and secondary sources, whether by analyzing archives, documents, economic databases, and financial instruments or by interviewing key market actors or conducting ethnographies of financial events."
