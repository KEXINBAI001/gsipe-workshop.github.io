excerpt: "Sayumi Miyano is a  Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. She studies politics of global governance, foreign direct investment, and trade. Her first set of research examines how international organizations publish information or standards under scientific uncertainty, such as in energy, environment, or technology, and how domestic political actors affect these decisions. Her second line of research considers how multinational firms exert political influence at home and abroad, what nationality means for MNCs, and more generally, the firm-state relationships under today's extensive global value chains."
