excerpt: "I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Utah State University, on-track to graduate in December 2021. I am primarily, a natural resource economist interested in using economic theory and modeling to facilitate policies revolving around natural resources, agriculture, and trade. My research has centered around the application of econometric and general equilibrium tools to water economics, specifically, urban water and water trade in the Western US and India. In my doctoral dissertation, I study the impacts of Owens Valley water transfer in the1900s on Los Angeles’ economic growth and apply a cost-benefit type analysis for a water sharing project in Utah.
