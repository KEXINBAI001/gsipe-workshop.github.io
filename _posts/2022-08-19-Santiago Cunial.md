excerpt: "I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Pennsylvania, and a graduate fellow at the Penn Development Research Initiative and the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. I am interested in comparative politics and the political economy of development, with a substantive focus on environmental politics in the Global South. In my dissertation, I study the conditions under which states can facilitate a fast takeoff of clean energies, with a regional focus on Latin America. My research employs mixed methods to understand how business-state relations shape greening policies, with a regional focus on Latin America. I analyze how and when green policy reforms restructure incentives for key private-sector stakeholders in the energy sector."
