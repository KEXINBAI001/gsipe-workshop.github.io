excerpt: "I am Shengqiao Lin, currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin. My research centers on state-business relations with a regional focus on China. I am interested in how firms strategically respond to government intervention (e.g., policy shift, regulation, sanction), and how these interactions shape governance outcomes. My dissertation studies firm behavior responding to political risk in China using a mixed-methods approach that combines causal inference, computational methods, and in-depth interviews. My job market paper won the Franklin L. Burdette/Pi Sigma Alpha Award for the best conference paper of APSA in 2023."
