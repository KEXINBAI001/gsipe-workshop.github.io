excerpt: "My name is Jing Qian, and I am a Postgraduate Research Associate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University, where I defended my dissertation in May 2023. I am also affiliated with the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance. My dissertation explores the domestic and international politics of international taxation, with a focus on why — for decades — governments have been reluctant and unable to curb tax avoidance. More broadly, I study the politics of public finance, as well as transparency and replicability in quantitative research. My dissertation is supported by the Princeton University Multi-Center Graduate Student Dissertation Grant. Some of my work has been published in International Organization and Public Administration."
