excerpt: "I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University and earned my PhD in Political Science from the University of California Berkeley in 2021. My research investigates how so-called fragile states cooperate with (0r contest) international efforts to mitigate suffering and improve the welfare of their residents. I investigate these issues of global concern in Sahelian and West African states, where foreign intervention has profound consequences for governance. My work has been published in the Journal of Politics, the Journal of Experimental Political Science, and PS: Political Science & Politics."
