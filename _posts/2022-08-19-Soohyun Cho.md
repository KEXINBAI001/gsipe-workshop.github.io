excerpt: "I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Ohio State University. I specialize in IPE and political methodology, with a focus on the interdependence of economic globalization and labor markets. Using survey experiments, causal inference, and natural language processing (NLP), I investigate (1) norm diffusion and firm compliance in supply chains and (2) workers' attitudes toward trade (especially gender gaps in trade attitudes). Before joining Ohio State, I earned my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science at Seoul National University, South Korea. My work has been supported by the Fulbright Fellowship (2016-2018) and the Presidential Fellowship at OSU (2022-2023)."
