In my dissertation, I study the conditions under which states can facilitate a fast takeoff of clean energies, with a regional focus on Latin America. My research employs mixed methods to understand how business-state relations shape greening policies, with a regional focus on Latin America. I analyze how and when green policy reforms restructure incentives for key private-sector stakeholders in the energy sector.</p>

  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate and NSF Graduate Fellow in the Department of Political Science at the UC San Diego. My research explores the political economy of place-or how local economies affect policy preferences and behaviors. Guided by economic geography theories, I identify the ways in which individuals form relationships with the places they live, and quantify these relationships with spatial and machine learning measurement techniques. My research applies these to reconsider important questions in political economy: does economic exposure to trade affect globalization attitudes, and do these attitudes affect voting; does inequality affect support for redistribution?</p>

  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>I am a PhD candidate at NYU. I study IPE with a focus on international cooperation. My research disentangles the mechanisms of how interdependence shapes incentives in international cooperation, which affects the design, functioning, and even survival of international institutions. My job market paper examines the role of the WHO in facilitating states' cooperation with disease outbreak reporting. It reveals that information dissemination by international organizations (IOs) to their members empowers weak IOs to induce deeper cooperation than what their resources permit. I also study how global value chains lead to the decline of international institutions and firms' influence over trade barriers.</p>

  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>I study the politics of the global technological and scientific frontier, focusing on the political consequences of the free flow of knowledge across national borders. In my dissertation, I study the conditions under which those made obsolete by global technological change organize and undermine the ability of societies to adjust to a changing world economy. The main case in my dissertation looks at political responses to technological obsolescence from the Industrial Revolution in South Asia during the first era of globalization.  Other cases include the invention of synthetic dyes by German chemists and the effects of industrial automation in the contemporary US. I also have a secondary research agenda in which I study the role of scientific consensus in international cooperation over environmental issues such as climate change.</p>
