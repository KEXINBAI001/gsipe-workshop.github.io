**Abstract:**

This dissertation prospectus proposes measuring the impact of Colombia's peace process by comparing the experiences of former FARC fighters under two reintegration tracks (individual v collective) offered to them and the experiences of civilians with whom they interact. While both tracks offer aid, one track helps ex-fighters develop increased social and economic ties and thus integrate better into society and ponder less on returning to war. Because collective reintegration settlements vary from each other, this prospectus proposes comparing ex-fighters within two municipalities in which both tracks operate. To do so, I use two ex-fighter sub-groups: collective aid/treated v individual aid/controlled. This project also measures levels of community acceptance of ex-fighters who have moved into formerly civilian areas, ex-fighter acceptance of civilians, and both aggregated for an overall social cohesion score. Further, I survey several civilian sub-groups by distance to the reintegration settlement: the civilians living in villages surrounding the reintegration settlement (treated), (semi-treated) civilians in town, (semi-treated) civilians living in other villages, and (controlled) civilians in distant villages. By comparing civilian responses based on distance to ex-fighters, I can track the flow of aid throughout the municipality to measure the impact of aid received on acceptance and economic and social cohesion. Finally, in comparing Colombiaâ€™s unique dual-track reintegration programming and civilian responses, this study theorizes an ex-fighter reintegration market and a reintegration resource-curse.
