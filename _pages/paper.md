**Abstract:**

This paper investigates the role of multinational enterprises on variety growth. I introduce a new measurement of varieties based on trademarks, which is able to encompass all sectors of the economy and offer a unique perspective on the country of origin of varieties. Using data on federal trademarks registered in the United States between 1989 and 2014, I uncover a surprising trend of declining variety entry rates, despite a contemporaneous increase in imports. Detailed Chinese customs data show that the entry of Chinese firms into exporting is associated with Chinese variety gains but non-Chinese variety losses for US consumers, while multinational activity from China has a mildly positive effect on non-Chinese varieties. Therefore, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between Chinese import competition and product innovation in the United States, challenging the assumption that all trade flows result in equal gains from variety.
