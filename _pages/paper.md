**Title:** ["*The Politics of Compulsory Licensing - Electoral Accountability and Regulatory Threat*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
A burgeoning literature on private regulation focuses on the initiatives set forth by private actors, leaving unexplained how political institution that they belong to shapes their strategic choice. I argue that whether the public, activists and the like, put pressure on the government for regulation renders government regulation more threatening to firms, leading to more private regulation. Using game theory, I show how democratic states signal their willingness to secure public access to medicines, where both legislators and the executive are put under domestic political pressure. To test its empirical implication, I construct a new dataset on compulsory licensing and examine when pharmaceuticals reach licensing agreements against HIV/AIDS. I find that multinational pharmaceuticals license the drugs more voluntarily when democracies enact laws on compulsory licensing. I also find that democracies enact the laws earlier than autocracies as lawmakers meet the demands of the public by holding the executive accountable for limited access to patented drugs. The results illustrate when "political consumerism" breaks down and delineate conditions under which politicians reflect on voter preferences.

**Title:** ["*Comprehensive trade agreements, domestic institutions, and GVC integration: firm-level evidence*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Razeq_Sep2022_GSIPE - Copy.pdf)

**Abstract:**
There is considerable evidence that the deepening of trade integration has uneven distributional consequences for local firms, depending on their productivity. It is also well established that institutional differences across countries are an important source of comparative advantage in global trade and production. What has received less attention is the interplay between these two at the firm level in the context of the recent rise in GVCs. To fill the gap, this paper asks whether (and why) the differences in the quality of domestic institutions across countries mediate the distributional effect of deep integration on firms’ integration in GVCs? To answer this question, I measure GVC integration at the micro- (firms) and the deepening of preferential integration at the macro- (country) levels and combine these with conventional measures of the quality of domestic institutions for 124 countries between 2006 and 2020. Leveraging the differential effect of trade integration on firms with different levels of productivity across different institutional environments, I find that when the regulatory quality of domestic institutions is high, the deepening of trade integration increases productive firms’ participation in GVCs - an effect that is not detected when the quality is low. By bringing the question of local institutions into the discussion of participation in GVCs and the distributional consequences of deep integration, the paper shows that the effect of trade liberalization on firms is conditioned not only on the heterogenous characteristics of firms, such as productivity, but also on the quality of local institutions.
