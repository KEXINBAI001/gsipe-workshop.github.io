Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/NicolasW.pdf">**The Ties that Bind: Bilateral Gains from Trade and Interstate Conflicts**</a>

**Abstract:**

Do countries that become more dependent upon each other engage in more or less conflict? This study investigates the relationship between trade and conflict taking into account industry-specific trade as well as domestic production networks. I define dependence between countries based on a country’s individual contribution to another country’s real wages which in turn are derived from a multi-industry trade model with input-output linkages. Exploiting exogenous variation in bilateral trade costs based on air and sea distances I show that larger bilateral gains from trade lead to greater political alignment. I furthermore provide evidence that bilateral dependence is associated with fewer bilateral sanctions and fewer interstate military disputes.
