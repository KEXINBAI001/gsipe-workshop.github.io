**Title:** ["*Legal uncertainty and its consequences: A natural language processing approach*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Legal uncertainty is widely recognized as negative for economic growth, and yet empirical evidence is limited due to the difficulty of producing comparable measures across time and regions. This paper develops a new index of legal uncertainty (LUI) based on legal texts, by extracting the information content in all laws approved in a country and year to calculate the unforecastable component in legal content. I present the index construction, its robustness and comparison with institutional measures. When considering a full set of developing and developed economies I show great variability in legal uncertainty across countries and institutional frameworks. I then apply the index to provide evidence on the impact of legal uncertainty over the financial decisions of firms. Results show that, in the event of an increase in legal uncertainty, firms react by slowing down investments and laying off workers.
