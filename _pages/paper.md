**Title:** ["*Comprehensive trade agreements, domestic institutions, and GVC integration: firm-level evidence*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Razeq_Sep2022_GSIPE - Copy.pdf)

**Abstract:**
There is considerable evidence that the deepening of trade integration has uneven distributional consequences for local firms, depending on their productivity. It is also well established that institutional differences across countries are an important source of comparative advantage in global trade and production. What has received less attention is the interplay between these two at the firm level in the context of the recent rise in GVCs. To fill the gap, this paper asks whether (and why) the differences in the quality of domestic institutions across countries mediate the distributional effect of deep integration on firms’ integration in GVCs? To answer this question, I measure GVC integration at the micro- (firms) and the deepening of preferential integration at the macro- (country) levels and combine these with conventional measures of the quality of domestic institutions for 124 countries between 2006 and 2020. Leveraging the differential effect of trade integration on firms with different levels of productivity across different institutional environments, I find that when the regulatory quality of domestic institutions is high, the deepening of trade integration increases productive firms’ participation in GVCs - an effect that is not detected when the quality is low. By bringing the question of local institutions into the discussion of participation in GVCs and the distributional consequences of deep integration, the paper shows that the effect of trade liberalization on firms is conditioned not only on the heterogenous characteristics of firms, such as productivity, but also on the quality of local institutions.
