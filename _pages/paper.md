**Title:** ["*Commerce, Coalitions, and Global Value Chains: Evidence from Coordinated and Collective Lobbying*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/GSIPE_HaoZhang_1020.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Global Value Chains (GVCs) have connected firms in increasingly complex networks within and across national borders. However, recent political economy models assume away interdependencies between producers and thus fail to explain pervasive trade coalitions across industries and firms. I argue that linkages through the same foreign partner foster common interests and collective actions among GVC firms. I compile supply chain datasets for all public firms and directly test my theory using network models. I find that US firms with GVC linkages tend to lobby together, hire the same lobbyist, and lobby on the same bill. Furthermore, GVC linkages among lead firms increase collective lobbying through trade as- sociations. Finally, I document the independent effects of GVC coalitions on the network of preferential trade agreements among 62 major economies. These results provide micro- foundations for new coalitional politics under GVCs and challenge the common assumption about industries and firms as isolated actors.
