Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/JMP - Federica lo Polito.pdf">**Italians First: Refugee Reception Policy and National Identity**</a>


**Abstract:**

This paper investigates the effects of intergroup contact with immigrants on natives' attachment to national identity. During the European refugee crisis, the Italian government implemented an emergency reception policy to address the unprecedented number of refugees. Using administrative data on the universe of reception centers that were opened between 2014 and 2018 and exploiting time and geographic variation in the opening of such centers, I first examine the effect of contact with refugees on behavior-based proxies of attachment to the nation. I find that the presence of refugees reduces support for regionalist political movements and increases the likelihood of voting for parties that promote national unity and identity. Municipalities receiving refugees also exhibit an increased level of social capital, which is proxied by consent to organ donation, and a significant increase in expenditures for non-excludable goods and transfers received from other levels of government. Finally, I construct an index of national identity by leveraging on rich data from Google Trends on terms related to Italian culture. Results show a significant increase in the search volume for these terms in municipalities that experienced intergroup contact. Overall, the evidence suggests that intergroup contact strengthens national identity among Italians.
