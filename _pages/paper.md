**Abstract:**

Anti-globalization movements in advanced economies have attracted substantial scholarly attention, but to what extent do cumulative experiences of openness as opposed to personal socioeconomic status at a given time affect trade support? Adopting an inductive approach, this study argues that individuals can learn and form trade preferences from their early exposure to trade openness and economic growth. Employing cross-national datasets that cover individuals' preferences during the last three decades and exploring the exogenous shock caused by the Asian Financial Crisis, I demonstrate that increasing exposure to openness during economic upswings leads to significantly stronger later-life trade support. Conversely, experiencing greater openness during economic downturns could result in heightened opposition to international trade. Further examination indicates past experiences contribute to sustained trade support by enhancing individuals' material well-being and cultivating cosmopolitan perceptions. This paper documents the crucial impacts of personal experiences on political attitudes and provides a novel perspective for explaining the formation of trade preferences.
