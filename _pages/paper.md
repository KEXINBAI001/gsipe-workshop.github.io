**Abstract:**

Climate change is theorized to be increasing the frequency and intensity of weather across the world, and extant work shows natural disasters are important for violent and non-violent politics. In this study, I examine the impact of extreme weather events on public opinion regarding trust in politicians, governments, and democracy. Drawing on two surveys conducted in Brazil and Mexico, the study finds that extreme weather events have heterogeneous effects on communities depending on individual socioeconomic vulnerability and the degree of clientelistic governance. The study argues that extreme weather events lower trust in elections, as the distribution of resources becomes even more crucial in their aftermath. The study further reveals that where clientelism is dominant, extreme weather events cause non-vulnerable individuals to trust local governments less, while more vulnerable individuals come to trust local governments more. The findings suggest that drought is critical in explaining trust in elections and local government. The study’s main contribution is its demonstration of the localized nature of extreme weather’s effects, with attitudes regarding national political actors and governments being less significantly impacted due to closer linkages created by clientelism with local politicians.
