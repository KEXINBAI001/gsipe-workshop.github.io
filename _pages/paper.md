**Title:** **<a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/221204_securitization of trade_gsipe.pdf">Trading with China, Is It Really a Security Issue?</a>**

**Abstract:**
Not even ten years ago, the then-US President Barack Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping proclaimed a potential start of a "new model of relations between great powers" at the Sunnylands Estate in California, and the pacifying effect of trade seemed ever more convincing. However, the sunny weather rapidly started to change after Donald Trump succeeded as the US President in 2016. Amidst threats and self-accolades, the Trump administration launched a trade 'war' against China. Although there has not been an exchange of gunshots, the US-China relation is far from being 'peaceful', including the trade area. Security terminology such as 'war', 'attack', and 'arms race' has been dominating the discussion around the bilateral economic relation. The general public seems to share this hostility and suspicion towards China.

This study aims to explore this phenomenon more deeply: When do Americans think of international trade as a national security issue rather than just as an economic issue? Is securitization of trade unique to the US-China trade relation? We first explore the different potential sources of securitization of trade: elite cues, institutional linkage, decreasing power gap between the US and China, and spillover effect of personal economic security. We then examine whether the securitization of trade is dependent on the trade partner, as well as subjects' foreign policy dispositional characteristics. Our initial results suggest that the power gap cue is the most powerful source of securitization, but just mentioning negative economic aspects of trade can trigger securitization of trade even for a benign ally, such as Canada.
