**Abstract:**

The European Union (EU) has been characterised as a conflicted trade power. It seeks to secure market access for its exporting companies while simultaneously using trade as a foreign policy tool to propagate its institutional values such as human rights and democracy. Given the EUâ€™s dualistic approach to trade, this paper investigates which factors influence the inclusion of democracy-related provisions in EU preferential trade agreements (PTAs). Using novel data on democracy-related provisions in PTAs, the paper analyses 112 PTAs signed by the EU from 1960-2023. The results show that PTAs with countries that the EU has identified as economically significant incorporate relatively fewer democracy clauses. Furthermore, agreements with consolidated democracies are observed to contain a greater number of democracy clauses than those with autocratic regimes. Overall, the results suggest that the EU adopts varied frameworks for its trade agreements, tailored to the strategic importance of each trading partner. This paper highlights the EU's dual role as both a commercial and a normative power and reflects its internal conflict between gaining market shares and exporting democratic principles. This paper contributes to the literature on EU trade policy, the design of PTAs, and democracy within international trade.
