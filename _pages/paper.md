**Title:** ["*Empowered by Information: Disease Outbreak Reporting at the World Health Organization*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/ge_zoe_jmp.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Can international organizations (IOs) facilitate deeper cooperation from states than what their material resources permit? The authority over information dissemination to their members empowers weak IOs. I investigate the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in facilitating state cooperation with the reporting of disease outbreaks. After the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the WHO was authorized by the International Health Regulations reform to disseminate outbreak information to the international community without waiting for states to confirm first. When a state's attempt to conceal diseases leads to the WHOâ€™s information dissemination, states anticipate trade and travel restrictions imposed by the international community ex post. Those who might have been reluctant to disclose before the reform do so now more frequently. This is especially true for countries with weak linkages to the international community, where those restrictive measures might bind more tightly. Using the number of Disease Outbreak News to measure state cooperation and linkages to different countries to proxy for linkages to the international community, I find that states with weak political alignment with the U.S. and its allies have fewer reports before the reform, confirming the presence of outbreak concealment. The reform increased reporting from those previously uncooperative states, suggesting that more information authority may exacerbate the influence of powerful actors in IOs.
