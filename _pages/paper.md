Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Felipe.pdf">**Unions and protectionist populism: The role of unions in the backlash against globalization**</a>


**Abstract:**

The connection between import competition, economic nationalism and the rise of political extremism has been well-established, but little is known about the mechanisms that drive it. I argue that labor unions are essential institutions that protect society from these outcomes. I posit that strong labor unions increase the cost of using populist-politics for politicians, hamstringing populism. I provide evidence for my claims using data from the U.S. (2002-2016) and a shift-share that leverages quasi-exogenous variation in import competition, at the congressional district level. I find that where unions have weakened the most pre-treatment, import competition leads to an increase in the use of populist rhetoric, a negative effect on voters' attitudes towards cosmopolitanism,  and an increase in voters' support for economic nationalism. I also show that import competition leads to a reduction in congresspeople's support of unions' interests in policy making, especially regarding welfare policy, explaining the aforementioned findings. I also show that these findings reflect a dynamic process insofar as union activities fall with import competition.
