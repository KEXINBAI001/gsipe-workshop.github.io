**Title:** ["*The Politics of Compulsory Licensing - Electoral Accountability and Regulatory Threat*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
A burgeoning literature on private regulation focuses on the initiatives set forth by private actors, leaving unexplained how political institution that they belong to shapes their strategic choice. I argue that whether the public, activists and the like, put pressure on the government for regulation renders government regulation more threatening to firms, leading to more private regulation. Using game theory, I show how democratic states signal their willingness to secure public access to medicines, where both legislators and the executive are put under domestic political pressure. To test its empirical implication, I construct a new dataset on compulsory licensing and examine when pharmaceuticals reach licensing agreements against HIV/AIDS. I find that multinational pharmaceuticals license the drugs more voluntarily when democracies enact laws on compulsory licensing. I also find that democracies enact the laws earlier than autocracies as lawmakers meet the demands of the public by holding the executive accountable for limited access to patented drugs. The results illustrate when "political consumerism" breaks down and delineate conditions under which politicians reflect on voter preferences.
