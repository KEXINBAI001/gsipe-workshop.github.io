**Title:** **<a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Hulvey_China_Polarization.pdf">Polarizing the United Nations: China’s Rise and the Dimensions of Ideological Change</a>** 

**Abstract:**

Rather than overturning the liberal order or maintaining the status quo, China pursues more subtle strategies of
ideological change that rest on persuasion and “discourse power.” This research explores change through China’s
motivation to reshape the information order governing the internet from a liberal to statist ideology. To institutionalize and lock in change, China pursues rhetorical strategies designed to convince and persuade. By developing a theory of ideological persuasion, I speculate that China’s message of cyber sovereignty is widely attractive, but China’s leadership creates polarization between liberal and non-liberal states. By building an original corpus of texts from prominent cybersecurity negotiations at the United Nations and conducting an elite experiment with diplomats, I test the degree and causes of support for a statist ideology. Text analysis uncovers widespread ideological polarization, and the experiment identifies the cause. China’s leadership, rather than the values of the statist order, creates liberal backlash while maintaining the support of non-liberal states. This research concludes with a discussion of the implications of polarization. Given many liberal institutional designs favor a majority, polarization may not be enough to hold China back from institutionalizing ideological shifts.
