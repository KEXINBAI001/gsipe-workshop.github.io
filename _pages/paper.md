**Title:** ["*Global Production Sharing and the New Demands for Deep Preferential Trade Agreements*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Why do contemporary trade agreements invest so heavily in controlling a complex and disparate set of non-trade policy areas? In this paper, I argue that the rise of global value chains (GVCs) explains the evolving institutional design of preferential trade agreements (PTAs). GVC-integrated firms, whose cross-border production strategies are highly vulnerable to changes in foreign governments’ regulatory policies, demand deeper commitments in non-trade policy areas. Non-GVC exporters are concerned only with market access and so prefer shallow PTAs; domestic-only firms don’t support PTAs at all. To test this argument, I employ a novel decomposition of global input-output tables which measures the extent of GVC and non-GVC trade integration across countries. I find that the level of GVC-integrated production is positively associated with the level of regulatory policies in PTAs, while non-GVC exporting is only positively associated with market access provisions in PTAs. The paper, therefore, highlights how changes in the structure of global production shape the scope of regulatory commitments in trade agreements.
