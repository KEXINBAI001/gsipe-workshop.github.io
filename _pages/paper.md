**Title: Green Collars at the Voting Booth: Material Interest and Environmentalist Voting** 

**Abstract:**

Can the transition toward a "greener" economy achieve sufficient support in the electorate to ensure it is politically sustainable? We study how preferences for environmental policy and electoral support for environmental platforms are affected by how one's skills are expected to be demanded in a greener economy. The starting point is that environmental concern and support for green policies can be affected by more direct economic concerns among voters. We rely on individual European Social Survey data over two decades in 15 European countries, combined with scores of "greenness" and "brownness" for occupations that capture how demanded or penalized an occupation can be due to the ecological transition. We provide evidence on how economic self-interest shapes support for environmental policy, for Green parties, and for parties with pro-environment policy platform. To infer causality, we use historical data from the European Labor Force Survey and construct out-of-sample probabilities of being employed in a green job to isolate exogenous variation in green employment. We find that individuals that might benefit from the ecological transition vote more for environmentalist and Green parties, while the opposite holds for people more at risk on the labor market.
