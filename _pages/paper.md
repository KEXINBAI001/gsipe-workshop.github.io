Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Cha,Osgood.2024.GSIPE.pdf">**Firms, Trade Policy, and Special Interest Institutions**</a>

**Abstract:**

Large firms are prime beneficiaries from globalization, but when are their voices amplified, resulting in freer trade? Special interest institutions — political rules and regulations which make it easier for interest groups to participate in politics — empower both industry associations and big firms. Consequently, special interest institutions will lead to lower trade barriers in industries where large firms are pro-trade, while raising trade barriers in industries where firms share uniformly anti-trade preferences. We test these ideas using data on tariffs, trade, and global value chain integration across hundreds of countries and thousands of products. We therefore contribute to the literature on domestic political institutions and trade policy, and explain how political institutions shape the influence of pro-globalization firms.
