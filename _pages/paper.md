**Abstract:**

Remittances are the single most important source of foreign finance for emerging economies worldwide, yet political economists have not studied the political effects of remittances as much as they have other forms of global economic flows. I argue that remittances increase the participation of recipients in the macro-economy, changing and amplifying their political-economic interests. The best way for them to advocate these interests is not through voting, but by finding non-electoral pathways for exercising political voice. I test this theory using several different estimators, accounting for self-selection and country level institutional differences which could attenuate the personal effect of remittances. I find robust evidence in favor of my argument across specifications using Wave 7 of the Afrobarometer. My findings imply that recent work focusing on the linkages between remittances and democracy should consider the ways in which individuals can advocate their interests beyond formal electoral channels.
