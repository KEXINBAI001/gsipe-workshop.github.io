Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Wu.2024(GSIPE).pdf">**Strategized Exit: Sunset Clauses and Unilateral Terminations of BITs**</a>


**Abstract:**

Since peak enthusiasm in the 1990s, governments worldwide have increasingly renegotiated or terminated bilateral investment treaties (BITs). This paper examines the politics underlying this trend, asking how choices of institutional design–specifically the length of the validation duration of sunset clauses – correlate with subsequent decisions of institutional exit. Sunset clauses were designed to lock in capital-importing countries with treaty responsibilities. A long sunset period, however, may benefit host governments in a way that contradicts the purpose of the clauses. Examining 473 BITs across 112 countries and 50 years, the paper demonstrates that a BIT party is more likely to unilaterally terminate its treaty when the invoked sunset clause can pose a longer-term threat to bilateral investment relations. States are most likely to use the strategy of BIT exit when they are experiencing a decline in GDP growth and thus a decrease in relative position on the negotiation table. The paper contributes to the emerging literature on institutional exit by indicating how particular forms of exit may be used to gain leverage in bargains.
