**Abstract:**

Overseas development finance plays a pivotal role in China's expanding global engagement. Prior scholarship often underestimates the commercial astuteness of Chinese capital, portraying it as exceptionally "patient" due to its higher tolerance of risk compared to Western capital, which prioritizes short-term gains. However, we demonstrate that this narrative overlooks the calculated business decisions behind much Chinese overseas lending. Specifically, we find that in risky countries, China demands collateral in the form of natural resources and charges higher interest rates on its loans. This commercially motivated finance, combined with the moral hazard posed by Chinese state-owned enterprises, heightens the risk of sovereign default in the Global South. Our empirical analysis of the terms of Chinese overseas loans committed between 2000 and 2021 and Western sovereign bond spreads shows that far from being patient, Chinese capital employs hard-nosed business tactics akin to Western capital. Additionally, we draw on qualitative case studies based on field interviews in the Congo, Ecuador, and Ghana. We propose three mechanisms—two that play out in borrowing countries themselves and one that relates to China's appetite for natural resources—to explain this finding: corruption, political business cycles, and the importance of the debtor country's production of the resource used as loan collateral to China. These findings complicate narratives of Chinese altruism, showing that much state lending remains motivated by returns, even while accomplishing broader geopolitical aims. Recognizing the business pragmatism underlying Chinese global finance is critical for understanding the market-driven logic, incentives, and risks for recipients of its capital.
