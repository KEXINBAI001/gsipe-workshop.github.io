**Title:** ["*Regime Complexity and Overlapping Information: The Case of Energy Projections*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/GSIPE_miyano.pdf)

**Abstract:**
International organizations (IOs) provide critical information for policy making and fa- cilitate international cooperation. Their influence creates incentives for IOs to provide infor- mation to secure their own reputation while meeting their policy preferences. What a↵ects IOs’ strategic decisions on which information to provide? I argue that the emergence of competing organizations a↵ects both the quantity and quality of information IOs provide. I theorize that the emergence of a competing IO in the same issue area (e.g., energy policy) can cause existing IOs to release information they would otherwise prefer to withhold about that subject, but only when such information is verifiable, as it leads to the incumbent IO’s motivation to maintain its own reputation. However, competition also creates an incentive for IOs to release unverifiable information that corresponds with their own preferences. Using a novel dataset on publications by major energy organizations between 2000-2017, I find that the entry of a competing IO, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), shifted the content of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) publications toward renewable en- ergy despite their longtime expertise in conventional energy sources. Yet, I also find that the creation of IRENA influenced IEA’s published unverifiable information, such as energy projections and policy recommendations, toward the preferences of the United States (the IEA’s major funder). The findings highlight that while IO competition can incentivize more information provision, it also creates incentives for IOs to move toward funding states to meet their demands.
