Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/partisan_isds_GSIPE.pdf">**Partisan Governments and ISDS Settlements**</a>


**Abstract:**

Why do some states settle investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) claims more frequently than others? This study examines how government partisanship influences the settlement of different types of ISDS claims, arising from either major or minor property rights infringements. Specifically, I argue that left-leaning governments, closely aligned with labor interests that generally favor foreign investment, are more inclined to settle ISDS claims arising from serious infringements on property rights. Conversely, the preference of left-leaning partisans for state regulatory autonomy leads these governments to be less likely to settle claims emerging from minor breaches, such as policy regulations affecting foreign investment values. Utilizing original hand-coded data on the level of international investment agreement (IIA) breaches since 2012, I find that left-leaning governments are more likely to settle ISDS claims arising from major IIA breaches, while being less likely to conclude ISDS claims associated with minor IIA breaches by settlement.
