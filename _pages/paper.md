**Abstract:**

Why does foreign direct investment lead to higher green spending in some cases and lower in others? This paper investigates the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and green spending in the context of China to answer this question. Existing literature presents contradictory findings on the impact of multinational corporation (MNC) activity on environmental degradation and environmental upgrading. This study aims to reconcile these discrepancies by considering the influence of MNCs' home country environmental performance and the local environmental pollution levels. I argue the variation in local green spending is partially a function of an MNCs home country's environmental performance. Additionally, visible climate degradation incentivizes China's local governments to invest in environmental services to maintain regime legitimacy. Green spending helps counteract pollution and reinforce regime legitimacy. However, the influence of MNCs' environmental performance and local pollution is interdependent. The interaction between foreign performance and local pollution leads to variations in legitimacy outcomes and spending patterns. I analyze the interaction of the latent local environmental pollution and the foreign environmental performance using a two-way fixed effects regression model. I use two novel datasets to conduct my analysis, one on firm-level FDI inflows to China, and another on local green spending at the city-level in China. I find foreign performance drives spending where local pollution is high to compensate degradation and where pollution is low governments spend as a complementing factor.
