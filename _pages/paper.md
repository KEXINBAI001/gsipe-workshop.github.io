Title: <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Malaysia_Paper.pdf">**Does Manufacturing Matter? Foreign investment and local linkages in the Malaysian solar industry**</a>


**Abstract:**

The US-China trade war created new opportunities for developing countries to attract foreign investment in solar manufacturing, which was historically concentrated in the United States, Germany, and China. To avoid United States and European Union tariffs on solar panel imports, China has moved solar panel manufacturing abroad to Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Renewable energy technology presents an important opportunity for developing countries seeking to both decarbonize and level up in global value chains, and industrial policy historically places significant emphasis on manufacturing as the foundation of domestic industrial upgrading. But does this manufacturing relocation create local linkages for countries that receive FDI? This paper evaluates how and why renewable energy manufacturing struggles to create local linkages, most importantly, for local solar installation. Drawing upon bilateral solar panel trade data, interviews with local Malaysian firms, and descriptive evidence regarding spatial patterns in local solar installation, I find that Chinese production relocation had no effect on local solar installation nor significant impacts on backwards linkages to suppliers. Rather, Chinese panels manufactured in Malaysia are destined for export to Western countries, because Chinese manufacturers in Malaysia profit more from exporting to the United States rather than selling to locals. Instead, Malaysian solar project owners actually import panels from mainland China. The only local linkage lies in the direct employment of locals among the manufacturing facilities themselves. This calls into question existing industrial policy scholarship that emphasizes the localization of production for downstream market growth and indicates that escalating global trade tensions can lead to inefficient externalities that do little to benefit local markets via technology transfer.
