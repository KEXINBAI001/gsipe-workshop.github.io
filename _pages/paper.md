**Abstract:**

Bilateral tax treaties (BTTs) enable multinational enterprises to engage in treaty shopping and lead to a drain on government tax revenue. Despite this, BTTs continue to proliferate with increasingly generous provisions, raising the puzzle of why governments are seemingly incentivized to perpetuate a system that creates tax avoidance opportunities for multinational enterprises through treaty shopping. This paper argues that the risk of treaty shopping, wherein investors exploit cheaper indirect routes through conduit countries for international payments, is a crucial driver of BTT network expansion. To address this risk, governments sign new BTTs with more favorable terms, leading to a vicious cycle that generates treaty cascades and a race to the bottom in withholding tax rates. Using original and comprehensive data on the universe of tax treaties and corporate tax codes covering more than 170 countries from 1980 to 2020, this paper provides empirical support for this argument. The results reveal that governments facing treaty-shopping risks are more likely to enter new BTTs and agree to lower withholding tax rates. These findings highlight the need for coordinated international efforts to address treaty shopping and shed light on
international economic cooperation.
