Title: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0g6wo4lwac6ldk42gr0mw/APSA_Automation_Culture.pdf?rlkey=ecck0pxx7v4hb6wjsgs3s9ww6&raw=1">**The Path from Automation to Populist Political Behavior**</a>


**Abstract:**

I investigate the impact of automation exposure on political behavior in post-industrial societies, with a specific focus on support for populism. I examine potential causal mechanisms by exploring the interplay between economic and cultural factors. Using double randomization of treatment and mediators in a survey experiment conducted in the US, I divide my sample into two groups: one is randomly assigned to either a treatment condition related to exposure to robots or AI replacing jobs, or a control condition related to technological development; the other experiences manipulation of both the treatment and the encouragement of mediators (marginalization and nostalgia). My findings reveal that feelings of marginalization and nostalgia mediate the effects of job-threatening technological change on support for populism and illiberal policies. To enhance external validity, I implement mediation analysis using survey data from the European Social Survey. The results help us understand why at-risk workers turn to radical right parties.
