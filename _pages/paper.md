**Title:** **<a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Nihan_Akhan_GSIPE.pdf">Patent ownership, trade and lobbying</a>**

**Abstract:**

This paper argues that patent ownership is an important determinant of trade related lobbying and it examines the engagement of firms in lobbying on intellectual property rights when they are exposed to trade shocks. By using the data of publicly listed firms and firm level federal lobbying reports in the US, I first show that patent-owner firms dominate trade lobbying. In addition, by investigating the impact of the China shock on lobbying related to intellectual property rights, I demonstrate that firms are more engaged in lobbying on intellectual property rights (IPR) when they are exposed to trade shocks. Using the identification strategy of Autor et al. (2013), I establish a causal link between import penetration from China and IPR lobbying. Findings suggest that firms increase their lobbying on intellectual property rights as a response to the import penetration from China. Results also highlight the heterogeneous impact on lobbying. Finally, at the industry level, this paper links trade lobbying to trade-related regulations.
