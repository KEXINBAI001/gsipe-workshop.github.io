**Title:** ["*The Politics of Compulsory Licensing - Electoral Accountability and Regulatory Threat*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Why are some small states---such as Ireland, Costa Rica, and Liechtenstein---effective in shaping the United Nations (UN) agenda, even in the face of powerful states' opposition? I argue that while material power is important in explaining some international organization (IO) politics, individual diplomats play a crucial role as well. States can influence the early stages of policymaking---when agendas are set---with diplomatic capital, a form of social power developed through skilled representation. By focusing on the late stages of policymaking---particularly voting on final resolutions, when it is easier to leverage economic and military resources---I argue that previous studies have overestimated the influence of powerful states. To test these claims, I assemble a dataset of proposed UN General Assembly agenda items and the tenure of all states' ambassadors from 1946-2019, and conduct interviews with diplomats from 49 states. Supporting these expectations, I find that states with greater diplomatic capital---measured by ambassador experience---are more successful at agenda-setting, even after accounting for material power. Consistent with my argument, I find that random shocks to ambassadorial tenure---ambassador deaths---have negative effects on diplomatic capital. These insights challenge our understanding of the relative importance of power and diplomacy in IOs, and more generally the extent to which small states influence international politics.
