**Title:** **<a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/MAllen-unbundling-20230206.pdf">Unbundling the State: Legal Development in an Era of Global, Private Governance</a>**

**Abstract:**
What happens to a public, domestic institution when its authority is delegated to a privately-run, transnational institution? In this article, I first present a theoretical framework for understanding how governmental tasks that have traditionally been "bundled" together in state institutions become "unbundled" and outsourced to private bodies. I apply this framework to international commercial arbitration (ICA), a widely-used system of cross-border commercial dispute resolution. I argue that ICA provides commercial actors an "exit option" from weak public institutions, thereby reducing pressure on the state to invest in capacity-enhancing reform. Using a variety of difference-in-differences estimators, I demonstrate that the enactment of strong protections for ICA leads to the gradual erosion of the quality of local legal institutions, particularly in countries with already weak legal systems. I test the underlying mechanism driving this dynamic using dispute data from the International Chamber of Commerce. I find that pro-arbitration laws increase the use of international arbitration by national firms. I find no evidence, however, that such laws increase the number of arbitrations that take place within a given jurisdiction and would therefore be subject to domestic oversight. This suggests that firms use ICA as an escape from domestic institutions. This paper contributes to debates on globalization and development as well as burgeoning work on the second-order effects of global governance institutions.
