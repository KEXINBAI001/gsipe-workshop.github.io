  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh and a Mellon Predoctoral Fellow. My main research interests lie at the intersection of international political economy and comparative politics. My dissertation generates novel insights into the political economy of job automation, the primary driver of economic polarization, by investigating the causal mechanisms influencing individuals' political attitudes and the impact of electoral institutions on political actors' responses. I study the interplay between economic, cultural, and institutional factors using mixed-methods approaches that combine quantitative analysis, text-as-data, survey experiment, and formal modeling. I am also interested in international trade, inequality, climate policy, and political methodology.</p>

  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>Drew Kaufman is an economic geographer and a SSHRC postdoctoral researcher at Queen's University, Canada, specializing in the debt of low-and-middle-income countries. His recently completed Ph.D. from the University of Toronto (2023) explored the political economy of the market for the Global South's debt. Drew's mixed-methods research traces capital as it circulates amongst lenders, borrowing nations, and global markets. He scrutinizes debt markets by drawing on both primary and secondary sources, whether by analyzing archives, documents, economic databases, and financial instruments or by interviewing key market actors or conducting ethnographies of financial events. </p>

  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>I am Shengqiao Lin, currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin. My research centers on state-business relations with a regional focus on China. I am interested in how firms strategically respond to government intervention (e.g., policy shift, regulation, sanction), and how these interactions shape governance outcomes. My dissertation studies firm behavior responding to political risk in China using a mixed-methods approach that combines causal inference, computational methods, and in-depth interviews. My job market paper won the Franklin L. Burdette/Pi Sigma Alpha Award for the best conference paper of APSA in 2023.</p>

I am also affiliated with the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance. My dissertation explores the domestic and international politics of international taxation, with a focus on why — for decades — governments have been reluctant and unable to curb tax avoidance. More broadly, I study the politics of public finance, as well as transparency and replicability in quantitative research. My dissertation is supported by the Princeton University Multi-Center Graduate Student Dissertation Grant. Some of my work has been published in International Organization and Public Administration. </p>
