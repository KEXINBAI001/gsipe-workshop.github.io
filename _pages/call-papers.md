Thanks to all who submitted an abstract for our Fall workshops! Decisions will be sent out soon.

[International political economy (IPE)](https://www.isanet.org/ISA/Sections/IPE) â€œseeks to advance knowledge of how political institutions, processes, and actors influence economic interactions, and conversely, how economic institutions, processes, and actors affect political interactions. IPE scholars examine the role of domestic drivers in shaping global politics as well as the influence of global drivers on domestic politics. Substantive issues this section focuses on international and regional regimes, private authority structures, welfare policies, social and environmental policies, monetary and exchange rate policies, global integration, international trade, international development and equity, international finance, multinational corporations, NGOs, and corporate social responsibility.''

We welcome submissions in Political Science and Economics ranging from papers in early stages to well-developed manuscripts and anything in between. We encourage submissions for projects that use a wide array of methods, including quantitative, qualitative, and a mixed approach. For Fall 2022, we plan to continue meeting at 12-1pm Eastern Time on a day to be determined. The first workshop will take place in September, and the last one will occur in December.

Our selection process is guided by the dual objectives of fostering an intellectually engaging workshop for attendees and correcting for systemic inequities in the discipline. Details on the selection process are outlined below. 

Please do not hesitate to contact the organizers with any questions. Please also feel free to circulate this call for papers to anyone who may be interested and direct them to the GSIPE website to sign up for our listserv.

**Selection Process**

Authors interested in presenting will submit a short title, an abstract (up to 250 words), dates for availability, and fill out a form answering the following questions:

- Do you identify as a member of a historically excluded demographic group in political science, including gender, race, and ethnicity?

- Have you had the opportunity to present your project at a workshop/seminar at your institution in the past year?

- Have you had the opportunity to present this project at APSA, ISA, ASSA, or any major conference in the last two years?

- Is your proposed presentation your job market paper?

Upon receiving submissions, we will remove author-identifying information (name and all answers to the above questions) from the abstracts. Each organizer will evaluate the author-blinded abstracts on a 0-5 scale according to the following criteria:

- Breadth of appeal and conduciveness to discussion: Does the paper pose a question that will be of interest to a broad cross-section of international political economy scholars, and that will prompt an engaging and productive conversation among participants?

- Originality and creativity: Does the paper pose a novel question, or does it make us think about a problem in a new light?

- Scores will be tabulated and averaged across the three organizers. The highest-scoring submissions will advance to the second stage. 

- In the second stage, we will add weights as a function of the representation- and need-based criteria outlined above. Specifically:
  - +0.5 for members of a historically excluded demographic group
  - +0.5 for individuals presenting versions of their job market papers
  - +0.5 for not having had an opportunity to present at an institutional workshop
  - +0.5 for not having had an opportunity to present at a major conference
