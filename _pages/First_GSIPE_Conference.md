The Graduate Student International Political Economy Workshop (GSIPE) is pleased to announce the **First GSIPE Conference on International Economics and Political Economy** to be held at **<a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>** at Waltham, Massachusetts, on **February 3-4, 2023**.

As part of APSA’s Special Projects Fund, this event is free and travel/caregiving grants will be available for participants. Zoom presentations are also possible.

GSIPE aims to provide a venue for graduate students to present their work and receive peer feedback, network, and build community. For this conference, we invited graduate students and postdocs from Economics and Political Science to submit their research (job market papers were especially encouraged). We particularly welcomed submissions from scholars who are underrepresented in these fields. 

The conference's purpose is to showcase research at the intersection of International Economics and Political Economy, broadly defined. Some specific topics that will be present are: Climate and Energy, International Finance and Development, Dependence and Value Chains, International Development, and Trade Policy.

## Schedule:

Please find the detailed schedule of the conference **<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmta7_UzJUqRhYYVZpWYA-_ty2ZfJpmg/view?usp=sharing">here</a>**.

## Format:

Presentations will last 30 minutes each. We invite the speakers to prepare their presentations so that they fit within this time. PDF format is preferred for the supporting slides.

Virtual presentations: We understand that some presenters will not be able to make the trip to Brandeis to present, mainly due to financial or political restrictions, or environmental reasons. We have therefore instituted a virtual presentation system to allow the authors of accepted papers the same publication opportunities as regular presenters. Virtual presentations will follow the same format as those in person.
