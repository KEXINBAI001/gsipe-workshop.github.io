The **First GSIPE Conference on International Economics and Political Economy** was held **<a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>** at Waltham, Massachusetts, on **February 3-4, 2023**.

The Conference took place at **<a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/university-events/departments/spaces/index.html">Brandeis University</a>**, at the Hassenfeld Conference Center (Geller Conference Room).

As part of APSA’s Special Projects Fund, the event was free and travel/caregiving grants were made available for participants. To achieve broad participation and accomodate the need of the participants, from both the Americas and Europe, the event took place in hybrid mode.

GSIPE aims to provide a venue for graduate students to present their work and receive peer feedback, network, and build community. For this conference, we invited graduate students and postdocs from Economics and Political Science to submit their research (job market papers were especially encouraged). We particularly welcomed submissions from scholars who are underrepresented in these fields. 

The conference's purpose was to showcase research at the intersection of International Economics and Political Economy, broadly defined. Some specific topics were Climate and Energy, International Finance and Development, Dependence and Value Chains, International Development, and Trade Policy.

## Schedule and papers:
The Conference run from Friday February 3rd, 8:40 am to Saturday February 4th, 1.30 pm.
